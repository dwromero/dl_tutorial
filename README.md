## Practical Session - Recognizing Numbers with DL -

### Installation

For this exercises we will use Google Colab. As a result, we won't need to install anything locally.

1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Once here, go to the GitHub tab and pass the URL of this repository, i.e., https://github.com/dwromero/dl_tutorial/
3. Here, you should be able to see a file called `DL_tutorial.ipynb`. Open it, and you are ready to go.


### Checking everything
Please check that everything is working properly before continuing. You should be able to run the first code cell of the Jupyter Notebook without any problems. If you have any issues, please let us know.
